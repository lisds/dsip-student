# Introduction

We have two tasks:

* "Data science and machine learning" - go deeper into the world of data
  science analysis.
* "in practice" - learn how to collaborate with tools for code.

# The structure

There are two parts to the structure:

* 

# Data science and machine learning

# In practice
