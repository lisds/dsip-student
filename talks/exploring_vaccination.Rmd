We are investigating the claim, made in [this substack article](https://thenobodywhoknowseverybody.substack.com/p/england-annus-horribilis), that there are more deaths in the UK from all causes among people vaccinated for Covid-19, compared to unvaccinated people.


The data comes from [this ONS page](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland).  Specifically, we have [this dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023/referencetableaug2023.xlsx).
