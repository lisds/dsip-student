We are investigating the claim, made in [this substack article](https://thenobodywhoknowseverybody.substack.com/p/england-annus-horribilis), that there are more deaths in the UK from all causes among people vaccinated for Covid-19, compared to unvaccinated people.


The data comes from [this ONS page](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland).  Specifically, we have [this dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1april2021and31may2023/referencetableaug2023.xlsx).

```{python}
# ls
```

```{python}
table_4 = pd.read_excel('referencetableaug2023.xlsx', 'Table 4', header=3)
table_4.tail()
```

```{python}
table_4['Cause of Death'].value_counts()
```

```{python}
all_causes = table_4[table_4['Cause of Death'] == 'All causes']
all_causes.tail()
```

```{python}
all_causes['Vaccination status'].value_counts()
```

```{python}
all_causes['is_vaccinated'] = all_causes['Vaccination status'] != 'Unvaccinated'
all_causes.head()
```

```{python}
sm_col = 'Age-standardised mortality rate / 100,000 person-years'
no_xes = all_causes[all_causes[sm_col] != 'x']
no_xes.head(20)
```

```{python}
no_xes.groupby('is_vaccinated')[sm_col].mean()
```

```{python}
no_xes.groupby(['Age group', 'is_vaccinated'])[sm_col].mean()
```
