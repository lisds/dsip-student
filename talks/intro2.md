# Continuing from last lesson

# On humility

> The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. ...
>
> ... Programming will remain very difficult, because once we have freed
ourselves from the circumstantial cumbersomeness, we will find ourselves free
to tackle the problems that are now well beyond our programming capacity....
>
> ...We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the
task with a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we
stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the
intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble
Programmers.

# On AI

* [A little bone loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdtHPZUkKWs)
* [You can't do data science with
  a GUI](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/you-cant-do-data-science-in-a-gui.html).
  Can you do data science with AI?
* Google translate, calculators, and AI

# To the demo

See [the nascent
notebook](https://github.com/lisds/dsip-student/blob/main/talks/exploring_vaccination.Rmd).

# What’s the Point of This Demo?

* We make assumptions in data science
* Is the data representative:
  * Of the question being asked?
  * Of the world and its implications?
* Data Science does not and cannot live in a theoretical vacuum.  _Data Science
  is a human-centered technical practice._
